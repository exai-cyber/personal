Password Toolkit is a compact C++ command-line utility that generates secure, random passwords according to configurable rules (right now only length), calculates password entropy, and provides approximate cracking-time estimates for brute-force and dictionary attacks.

Features: The tool allows specifying password length and custom passwords as input, computes entropy in bits with a human-readable strength assessment, and reports estimated cracking times for different attacker guess rates to help users choose stronger passwords.
